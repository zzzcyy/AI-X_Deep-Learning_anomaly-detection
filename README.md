### I. Proposal (Option A) 
- Motivation: Why are you doing this?
Since the popularization of electronic information, a large number of sensor devices have been installed in various industrial equipment to monitor the operating status of the equipment. But for a long time, people lack effective means to utilize the large amount of data generated by these sensors. With the development of AI technology, people have new means to process and utilize large amounts of data.In this project, our team will try to use machine learning methods to detect anomalies in some data generated in industrial production.
- What do you want to see at the end?  
We first train the model using part of the data as the training set. Then use the trained model to perform anomaly detection on the test set data. We expect to get higher F1 score and RECALL score.
